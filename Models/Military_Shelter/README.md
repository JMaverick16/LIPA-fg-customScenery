# Military_Shelter


The realization of this Shelter was my first personal contribution for the Flightgear simulator which took place 8 years ago. With the experience gained in modeling with Blender it has been perfected. The shelter is made so that aircraft can load as in parking positions, exit and re-enter. The objects of the scenario if well modeled without being afraid of details can contribute to enrich the experience of simulated flight.

Currently it must be positioned with the UFO as an object to enrich personal scenarios. The Shelter is NATO standard and therefore perfectly contextualizable in military airports. A further project, which however proceeds slowly, is the construction of LIBV Gioia del Colle taking care of the details of the structures with the same level as the Shelter.
