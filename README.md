# LIPA-fg-customScenery
Add-on scenery package that improves the already-existing work available on TerraSync made by J Maverick 16.
=====================

Overview
-------------------------
This repository contains additional static objects, improved airport data (tower position and elevation, parking positions, etc.) and OSM2city.py pylons for Aviano Air Base (LIPA), nearby airports, surrounding Italian territory and the Aviano-Piancavallo road.
The following airports are included: LIPA, LIPI, LIPD, LIDK, LIPG, LIPS, LIDB, LIPB, LIDA.

Installation instructions
-------------------------
After unzipping the package, select it via the FG launcher in the Add-ons -> Additional scenery folders section.
To see the OSM2city pylons, enable them in-sim on the menu at View -> Rendering Options -> Pylons.
Since December 2020, the AirBase models pack has been included directly in the repository, therefore no additional installation packs are required.
Since January 2022, all objects that have been revised inside TerraSync have been added for correct displaying of the models.

For the AI Truman carrier, copy over the xml file inside FGData/AI, then activate it via launcher as truman_adriatic or inside the AI dialog once in-sim.
